# IRCT-EXT

## What is the IRCT?
As part of the NIH BD2K PIC-SURE Center of Excellence http://www.pic-sure.org the HMS Department of Biomedical informatics https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu is developing an open-source infrastructure that will foster the incorporation of multiple heterogeneous patient level clinical, omics and environment datasets. This system embraces the idea of decentralized datasets of varying types, and the protocols used to access them while still providing a simple communication layer that can handle querying, joining, and computing on. The BD2K PIC-SURE RESTful API implementation is called Inter Resource Communication Tool (IRCT).

## What is the IRCT-EXT?
The IRCT Extension (IRCT-EXT) provides a way of adding additional functionality to an IRCT instance. Administrators can add any number of additional features without having to make code changes.

You can read more about some of the extensions here: https://github.com/hms-dbmi/IRCT-EXT/wiki
